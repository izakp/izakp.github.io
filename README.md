# goodlittlemoose

Help Jeb pet all the moose.

Make a moose.

Or

Let the moose run wild.

Every time you make a moose it will attempt to make another.

You can kill a moose before it produces offspring to manintain a constant population.

A Shepard herd.

Jeb will sing for you if there is equilibrium.
