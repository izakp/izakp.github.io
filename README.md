# goodlittlemoose

Help Jeb pet all the moose.

Make a moose yourself.

Or

Let us do it for you. Auto-moose.

How big is your herd?

Every time you make a moose it will make another.

You can kill the moose before it produces offspring to manintain a constant population.

Or

You can let the moose run wild.

Jeb will sing for you if the herd is just right.
